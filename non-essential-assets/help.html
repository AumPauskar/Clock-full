		<h1>Coding help</h1>
		<p>1.   When tkinter essential is mentioned it means only that the line of code is only used for tkinter and not
			for anything else.</p>
		<p>2.   Indentation are used in the form of TABS of length 4 not spaces</p>

		<h1>Indentation</h1>
		<p>The indentation used in this project are to be only done with TABS NOT SPACES</p>

		<h1>Layout</h1>
		<p>The clock is divided into 3 parts. The first part is the main clock part. This part is only used for displaying time
			in the form of a 24 hours hour clock. The second part is the stopwatch part which is used for displaying the 
			stopwatch in the form of hours:minutes:seconds. The third part is the timer part, the current plan is to have a 
			json file which decides how long timer will last.

		<h1>Why so many files???</h1>
		<img src = "file_desc.png" alt = "Files">
		<p>Now you might ask why so many files in the plan? Well to distribute the workload we have made a set of different
			filetypes to accomadate different requirements.
		</p>
		<!--1. main.py-->
		<h5>1.	main.py</h5>
		<p>Firstly the elephant in the room is main.py, it controls 
			all the major workloads of the program and has all the labels inside it. If you want to see the main core of the 
			program you go to main.py
		</p>
		<!--2. controller.py-->
		<h5>2.	controller.py</h5>
		<p>Controller.py handles all the side functions of the file for example it handles the information that is 
			passed from the json file to main.py
		</p>
		<!--3. settinggs.json-->
		<h5>3.	settings.json</h5>
		<p>settings.json will provide all the information for the main files in main. Mostly settings.json will
			give the size and text information to the main file and the countdown timer values.
		</p>
		<!--4. README.md-->
		<h5>4.	README.md</h5>
		<p>Will provide a small gist of all the modules used and the basic functionality of the application</p>
		<!--5. non-essential-assets-->
		<h5>5.	non-essential-assets</h5>
		<p>This folder will house all the non essential details regarding the application like help, logs and images 
			which are not necessary to run the code properly
