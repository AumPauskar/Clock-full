		<h2>Layout</h2>
		<p>The clock is divided into 3 parts. The first part is the main clock part. This part is only used for displaying time
			in the form of a 24 hours hour clock. The second part is the stopwatch part which is used for displaying the 
			stopwatch in the form of hours:minutes:seconds. The third part is the timer part, the current plan is to have a 
			json file which decides how long timer will last.
